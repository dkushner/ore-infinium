In order to use Ore Infinium, you must compile it..for now (I don't have time to make
binaries each day). Before you can do that, you must install the following:

IMPORTANT: this game requires at least OpenGL 3.2 or newer. You can figure this
out usually by running 'glxinfo'. Mesa doesn't yet have 3.2 drivers.
(so open source drivers won't work on Linux, for example. At least not until
I can (hopefully) support older GL versions).

To get started building this on Kubuntu (which is what I'm using as a test
machine, and is, as a rule, a good base for shipping software), you can install
some packages so that you don't have to build all of them yourself.


Here's a list, just to keep in mind. Commands are further down.

* SDL 2.x http://www.libsdl.org/hg.php (yet unreleased)

* protobuf (google's libprotobuf. needs both the library and the 'protoc'
binary, which e.g. ubuntu ships in a separate package

* enet (networking lib)

* GLEW

* librocket (GUI HTML/CSS C++ library)

* C++11 compatible compiler (GCC 4.7 is fine and clang 3.2)

* YAML-CPP (0.3.0. NOT GREATER THAN. Newer versions like 0.5 have a new API
which I unfortunately cannot yet use as evidently, nothing ships it yet, not
until the next version of ubuntu).

* ZLib (for compression, for both my network packets and file saving, etc.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------


If you're running Ubuntu 12.10 (which is what I support the most), then type:

'apt-get install libenet-dev libglew-dev libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler
libyaml-cpp-dev zlib1g-dev'

And just to make sure, if you've never done development, you probably need to
run:

'apt-get install mercurial git cmake'

Okay, so basically this gives us everything except the following:

* SDL 2.0(which is unreleased right now

and

* librocket

So those need to be built from source.
